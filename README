Collection of scripts for maintenance / cleaning of xenserver.

Tested on xenserver 6.2 and 6.5

One way of deployment on xenserver, is to use git

yum install git
git config --global http.sslVerify false
git clone https://github.com/colebooke/clean-xenserver.git

But generally these scripts just need running once, you could deploy manually or use your exsiting systems to deploy.
